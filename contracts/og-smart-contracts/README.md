# O&G Smart Contracts

**Status:** Base code copied from Empressa Smart Contracts - Ready for O&G adaptation

## Overview

This repository contains Solidity smart contracts for the O&G platform, adapted from Empressa's smart contract system. It handles asset tokenization, transactions, and revenue distribution for O&G assets.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Solidity
- **Framework:** Hardhat
- **Testing:** Hardhat test suite
- **Deployment:** Hardhat scripts

## Current Status

✅ Base code copied from Empressa Smart Contracts  
🔄 Ready for O&G asset type adaptation  
🔄 Ready for O&G transaction types  
🔄 Ready for Category-specific contract logic  

## Next Steps

1. Adapt asset types (Royalties → O&G Assets)
2. Update transaction types for O&G deals
3. Add Category A/B/C contract logic
4. Implement O&G-specific revenue distribution
5. Add override trading contracts
